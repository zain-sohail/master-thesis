% Thank Dima especially

This contribution was made possible through the generosity of the authors who shared their datasets: groups from DESY/FLASH, University of Mainz, FU Berlin, ETH Zürich for the \gls{GdW} dataset \cite{kutnyakhovMultidimensionalPhotoemissionSpectra2024}, \citeauthor{heberMultispectralTimeresolvedEnergy2022} and groups from ETH Zürich, DESY/NanoLab and Aarhus University for the \gls{GrIr} dataset \cite{heberMultispectralTimeresolvedEnergy2022}, and \citeauthor{maklarTimeresolvedARPESRAW2022} for the \gls{WSe2} dataset \cite{maklarTimeresolvedARPESRAW2022}.

% Dataset providers

We acknowledge DESY (Hamburg, Germany), a member of the Helmholtz Association HGF, for the provision of experimental facilities. Parts of this research were carried out at PG2 beamline of FLASH. This research was also supported in part through the Maxwell computational resources operated at DESY, Hamburg, Germany.

The \texttt{Python} data science and visualization ecosystem was heavily employed in this thesis.
The usage of \texttt{Xarray} \cite{hoyerXarrayNDLabeled2017} for multidimensional dataset transformations, \texttt{matplotlib} \cite{hunterMatplotlib2DGraphics2007} for plotting of images and other figures, \texttt{pandas} \cite{thepandasdevelopmentteamPandasdevPandasPandas2024} for tabular assessment of data, \texttt{seaborn} \cite{waskomSeabornStatisticalData2021} for statistical plotting, \texttt{optuna} \cite{akibaOptunaNextgenerationHyperparameter2019} for hyperparameter optimization, are acknowledged by citation as this is preferred by these scientific libraries. 

Extensive use of the \texttt{SED} (\href{https://github.com/OpenCOMPES/sed}{https://github.com/OpenCOMPES/sed}) is made, especially allowing easy manipulation of the single-event dataframes with $>$\num{1e9} rows, extremely fast binning to multidimensional images and compatibility with HDF5 and tiff formats.

For deep learning, exclusively \texttt{PyTorch} \cite{paszkePyTorchImperativeStyle2019} has been used. We use the \texttt{UNET3D} shown in \cite{cicek3DUNetLearning2016}, implemented (modified to accommodate our needs) by \citeauthor{wolnyAccurateVersatile3D2020} \cite{wolnyAccurateVersatile3D2020}. \texttt{PyTorch} \texttt{Dataset} and \texttt{DataLoader} classes were extensively used to ease in experiments other than deep learning.

Many of the concepts about Statistical Learning Theory were introduced to the author by the lecture series \texttt{Algorithmic Foundations of Data Science} taught by Prof. Martin Grohe at the RWTH Aachen University.
