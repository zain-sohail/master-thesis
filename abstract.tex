In the realm of photoemission spectroscopy, the exploration of large multi-dimensional phase spaces necessitates time-intensive data acquisition to ensure statistical robustness. Despite the unparalleled capabilities of free-electron lasers (FELs), in peak brightness and ultra- short pulsed X-rays, the limitations of low repetition rates prolong the data acquisition process. This impedes the agility of decision making that could otherwise enhance experimental results in the limited and valuable beamtime. By employing denoising strategies to mitigate noise while preserving intrinsic information, our proposed approach aims to streamline the data acquisition process, and effectively manage the escalating size and complexity of multi-dimensional photoemission data.
