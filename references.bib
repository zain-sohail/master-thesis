The pulse duration was in the region of 10~fs, and peak powers of 10~GW were achieved. At a pulse repetition frequency of 700 pulses per second, the average extreme-ultraviolet power reached 20~mW. The output beam also contained a significant contribution from odd harmonics of approximately 0.6\% and 0.03\% for the 3rd (4.6~nm) and the 5th (2.75~nm) harmonics, respectively. At 2.75~nm the 5th harmonic of the radiation reaches deep into the water window, a wavelength range that is crucially important for the investigation of biological samples.},

In order to prove our point, we will introduce Optuna, an optimization software which is a culmination of our effort in the development of a next generation optimization software. As an optimization software designed with define-by-run principle, Optuna is particularly the first of its kind. We will present the design-techniques that became necessary in the development of the software that meets the above criteria, and demonstrate the power of our new design through experimental results and real world applications.

  abstract = {Image deblurring is an important topic in imaging science. In this review, we consider together fluorescence microscopy and optical/infrared astronomy because of two common features: in both cases the imaging system can be described, with a sufficiently good approximation, by a convolution operator, whose kernel is the so-called point-spread function (PSF); moreover, the data are affected by photon noise, described by a Poisson process. This statistical property of the noise, that is common also to emission tomography, is the basis of maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches introduced in the mid eighties. From then on, a huge amount of literature has been produced on these topics. This review is a tutorial and a review of a relevant part of this literature, including some of our previous contributions. We discuss the mathematical modeling of the process of image formation and detection, and we introduce the so-called Bayesian paradigm that provides the basis of the statistical treatment of the problem. Next, we describe and discuss the most frequently used algorithms as well as other approaches based on a different description of the Poisson noise. We conclude with a review of other topics related to image deblurring such as boundary effect correction, space-variant PSFs, super-resolution, blind deconvolution and multiple-image deconvolution.},

  abstract = {This book offers a comprehensive introduction to the central ideas that underpin deep learning. It is intended both for newcomers to machine learning and for those already experienced in the field. Covering key concepts relating to contemporary architectures and techniques, this essential book equips readers with a robust foundation for potential future specialization. The field of deep learning is undergoing rapid evolution, and therefore this book focusses on ideas that are likely to endure the test of time. The book is organized into numerous bite-sized chapters, each exploring a distinct topic, and the narrative follows a linear progression, with each chapter building upon content from its predecessors. This structure is well-suited to teaching a two-semester undergraduate or postgraduate machine learning course, while remaining equally relevant to those engaged in active research or in self-study. A full understanding of machine learning requires some mathematical background and so the book includes a self-contained introduction to probability theory. However, the focus of the book is on conveying a clear understanding of ideas, with emphasis on the real-world practical value of techniques rather than on abstract theory. Complex concepts are therefore presented from multiple complementary perspectives including textual descriptions, diagrams, mathematical formulae, and pseudo-code. Chris Bishop is a Technical Fellow at Microsoft and is the Director of Microsoft Research AI4Science. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and a Fellow of the Royal Society. Hugh Bishop is an Applied Scientist at Wayve, a deep learning autonomous driving company in London, where he designs and trains deep neural networks. He completed his MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence at Cambridge University. "Chris Bishop wrote a terrific textbook on neural networks in 1995 and has a deep knowledge of the field and its core ideas. His many years of experience in explaining neural networks have made him extremely skillful at presenting complicated ideas in the simplest possible way and it is a delight to see these skills applied to the revolutionary new developments in the field." -- Geoffrey Hinton "With the recent explosion of deep learning and AI as a research topic, and the quickly growing importance of AI applications, a modern textbook on the topic was badly needed. The "New Bishop" masterfully fills the gap, covering algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning, modern deep learning architecture families, as well as how to apply all of this to various application areas." - Yann LeCun "This excellent and very educational book will bring the reader up to date with the main concepts and advances in deep learning with a solid anchoring in probability. These concepts are powering current industrial AI systems and are likely to form the basis of further advances towards artificial general intelligence." -- Yoshua Bengio},

The network learns from these sparse annotations and provides a dense 3D segmentation. (2) In a fully-automated setup, we assume that a representative, sparsely annotated training set exists. Trained on this data set, the network densely segments new volumetric images. The proposed network extends the previous u-net architecture from Ronneberger et al. by replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts. The implementation performs on-the-fly elastic deformations for efficient data augmentation during training. It is trained end-to-end from scratch, i.e., no pre-trained network is required. We test the performance of the proposed method on a complex, highly variable 3D structure, the Xenopus kidney, and achieve good results for both use cases.},

  abstract = {We present a novel approach to still image denoising based on e ective filtering in 3D transform domain by combining sliding-window transform processing with block-matching. We process blocks within the image in a sliding manner and utilize the block-matching concept by searching for blocks which are similar to the currently processed one. The matched blocks are stacked together to form a 3D array and due to the similarity between them, the data in the array exhibit high level of correlation. We exploit this correlation by applying a 3D decorrelating unitary transform and e ectively attenuate the noise by shrinkage of the transform coe!cients. The subsequent inverse 3D transform yields estimates of all matched blocks. After repeating this procedure for all image blocks in sliding manner, the final estimate is computed as weighed average of all overlapping blockestimates. A fast and e!cient algorithm implementing the proposed approach is developed. The experimental results show that the proposed method delivers state-of-art denoising performance, both in terms of objective criteria and visual quality.},

  abstract = {CT imaging is widely used in medical science over the last decades. The process of CT image reconstruction depends on many physical measurements such as radiation dose, software/hardware. Due to statistical uncertainty in all physical measurements in Computed Tomography, the inevitable noise is introduced in CT images. Therefore, edge-preserving denoising methods are required to enhance the quality of CT images. However, there is a tradeoff between noise reduction and the preservation of actual medical relevant contents. Reducing the noise without losing the important features of the image such as edges, corners and other sharp structures, is a challenging task. Nevertheless, various techniques have been presented to suppress the noise from the CT scanned images. Each technique has their own assumptions, merits and limitations. This paper contains a survey of some significant work in the area of CT image denoising. Often, researchers face difficulty to understand the noise in CT images and also to select an appropriate denoising method that is specific to their purpose. Hence, a brief introduction about CT imaging, the characteristics of noise in CT images and the popular methods of CT image denoising are presented here. The merits and drawbacks of CT image denoising methods are also discussed.},

The competition hosted two tracks, which were based on two datasets sampled from the raw data, including hundreds of millions of ratings. The underlying ratings were given to four types of musical items: tracks, albums, artists, and genres, forming a four level hierarchical taxonomy. The challenge started on March 15, 2011 and ended on June 30, 2011 attracting 2389 participants, 2100 of which were active by the end of the competition. The popularity of the challenge is related to the fact that learning a large scale recommender systems is a generic problem, highly relevant to the industry. In addition, the contest drew interest by introducing a number of scientific and technical challenges including dataset size, hierarchical structure of items, high resolution timestamps of ratings, and a non-conventional ranking-based task. This paper provides the organizers' account of the contest, including: a detailed analysis of the datasets, discussion of the contest goals and actual conduct, and lessons learned throughout the contest.},

While most FELs generate around 100 photon pulses per second, FLASH at DESY can deliver almost two orders of magnitude more pulses in this time span due to its superconducting accelerator technology. This makes the facility a prime candidate to realize the next step in FELs---dividing the electron pulse trains into several FEL lines and delivering photon pulses to several users at the same time. Hence, FLASH has been extended with a second undulator line and self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) is demonstrated in both FELs simultaneously. FLASH can now deliver MHz pulse trains to two user experiments in parallel with individually selected photon beam characteristics. First results of the capabilities of this extension are shown with emphasis on independent variation of wavelength, repetition rate, and photon pulse length.},

However, the images captured by modern cameras are inevitably degraded by noise, which leads to deteriorated visual image quality. Therefore, work is required to reduce noise without losing image features (edges, corners, and other sharp structures). So far, researchers have already proposed various methods for decreasing noise. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we summarize some important research in the field of image denoising. First, we give the formulation of the image denoising problem, and then we present several image denoising techniques. In addition, we discuss the characteristics of these techniques. Finally, we provide several promising directions for future research.},

It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use immediately. Real examples, real stories from the authors' experience demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with practical advice for understanding assumptions and implementing methods for experiments and observational studies.

Conventional models of HHG that treat the driving and emitted fields classically are usually very successful but inherently cannot capture the quantum-optical nature of the process. Although prior work considered quantum HHG, it remains unknown in what conditions the spectral and statistical properties of the radiation depart considerably from the known phenomenology of HHG. The discovery of such conditions could lead to novel sources of attosecond light having squeezing and entanglement. Here, we present a fully-quantum theory of extreme nonlinear optics, predicting quantum effects that alter both the spectrum and photon statistics of HHG, thus departing from all previous approaches. We predict the emission of shifted frequency combs and identify spectral features arising from the breakdown of the dipole approximation for the emission. Our results show that each frequency component of HHG can be bunched and squeezed and that each emitted photon is a superposition of all frequencies in the spectrum, i.e., each photon is a comb. Our general approach is applicable to a wide range of nonlinear optical processes, paving the way towards novel quantum phenomena in extreme nonlinear optics.},

  abstract = {Photon number distributions of classical and non-classical light sources have been studied extensively, yet their impact on photoemission processes is largely unexplored. In this article, we present measurements of electron number distributions from metal needle tips illuminated with ultrashort light pulses with various photon quantum statistics. By varying the photon statistics of the exciting light field between classical (Poissonian) and quantum (super-Poissonian), we demonstrate that the measured electron distributions are changed substantially. Using single-mode bright squeezed vacuum light, we measure extreme statistics events with up to 65 electrons from one light pulse at a mean of 0.27 electrons per pulse---the likelihood for such an event equals 10-128 with Poissonian statistics. By changing the number of modes of the exciting bright squeezed vacuum, we can tailor the electron number distribution on demand. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that the photon statistics is imprinted from the driving light to the emitted electrons, opening the door to new sensor devices and to strong-field optics with quantum light and electrons.},

@article{huberRobustEstimationLocation,
  title = {Robust {{Estimation}} of a {{Location Parameter}}},
  author = {Huber, Peter J.},
  urldate = {2024-11-21},
  abstract = {This paper contains a new approach toward a theory of robust estimation; it treats in detail the asymptotic theory of estimating a location parameter for contaminated normal distributions, and exhibits estimators--intermediaries between sample mean and sample median--that are asymptotically most robust (in a sense to be specified) among all translation invariant estimators. For the general background, see Tukey (1960) (p. 448 ff.) Let \$x\_1, {\textbackslash}cdots, x\_n\$ be independent random variables with common distribution function \$F(t - {\textbackslash}xi)\$. The problem is to estimate the location parameter \${\textbackslash}xi\$, but with the complication that the prototype distribution \$F(t)\$ is only approximately known. I shall primarily be concerned with the model of indeterminacy \$F = (1 - {\textbackslash}epsilon){\textbackslash}Phi + {\textbackslash}epsilon H\$, where \$0 {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}epsilon {$<$} 1\$ is a known number, \${\textbackslash}Phi(t) = (2{\textbackslash}pi){\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}\} {\textbackslash}int{\textasciicircum}t\_\{-{\textbackslash}infty\} {\textbackslash}exp(-{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}s{\textasciicircum}2) ds\$ is the standard normal cumulative and \$H\$ is an unknown contaminating distribution. This model arises for instance if the observations are assumed to be normal with variance 1, but a fraction \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ of them is affected by gross errors. Later on, I shall also consider other models of indeterminacy, e.g., \${\textbackslash}sup\_t {\textbar}F(t) - {\textbackslash}Phi(t){\textbar} {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}epsilon\$. Some inconvenience is caused by the fact that location and scale parameters are not uniquely determined: in general, for fixed \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$, there will be several values of \${\textbackslash}xi\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ such that \${\textbackslash}sup\_t{\textbar}F(t) - {\textbackslash}Phi((t - {\textbackslash}xi)/{\textbackslash}sigma){\textbar} {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}epsilon\$, and similarly for the contaminated case. Although this inherent and unavoidable indeterminacy is small if \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ is small and is rather irrelevant for practical purposes, it poses awkward problems for the theory, especially for optimality questions. To remove this difficulty, one may either (i) restrict attention to symmetric distributions, and estimate the location of the center of symmetry (this works for \${\textbackslash}xi\$ but not for \${\textbackslash}sigma\$); or (ii) one may define the parameter to be estimated in terms of the estimator itself, namely by its asymptotic value for sample size \$n {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty\$; or (iii) one may define the parameters by arbitrarily chosen functionals of the distribution (e.g., by the expectation, or the median of \$F\$). All three possibilities have unsatisfactory aspects, and I shall usually choose the variant which is mathematically most convenient. It is interesting to look back to the very origin of the theory of estimation, namely to Gauss and his theory of least squares. Gauss was fully aware that his main reason for assuming an underlying normal distribution and a quadratic loss function was mathematical, i.e., computational, convenience. In later times, this was often forgotten, partly because of the central limit theorem. However, if one wants to be honest, the central limit theorem can at most explain why many distributions occurring in practice are approximately normal. The stress is on the word "approximately." This raises a question which could have been asked already by Gauss, but which was, as far as I know, only raised a few years ago (notably by Tukey): What happens if the true distribution deviates slightly from the assumed normal one? As is now well known, the sample mean then may have a catastrophically bad performance: seemingly quite mild deviations may already explode its variance. Tukey and others proposed several more robust substitutes--trimmed means, Winsorized means, etc.--and explored their performance for a few typical violations of normality. A general theory of robust estimation is still lacking; it is hoped that the present paper will furnish the first few steps toward such a theory. At the core of the method of least squares lies the idea to minimize the sum of the squared "errors," that is, to adjust the unknown parameters such that the sum of the squares of the differences between observed and computed values is minimized. In the simplest case, with which we are concerned here, namely the estimation of a location parameter, one has to minimize the expression \${\textbackslash}sum\_i (x\_i - T){\textasciicircum}2\$; this is of course achieved by the sample mean \$T = {\textbackslash}sum\_i x\_i/n\$. I should like to emphasize that no loss function is involved here; I am only describing how the least squares estimator is defined, and neither the underlying family of distributions nor the true value of the parameter to be estimated enters so far. It is quite natural to ask whether one can obtain more robustness by minimizing another function of the errors than the sum of their squares. We shall therefore concentrate our attention to estimators that can be defined by a minimum principle of the form (for a location parameter): \$T = T\_n(x\_1, {\textbackslash}cdots, x\_n) minimizes {\textbackslash}sum\_i {\textbackslash}rho(x\_i - T),\$ {\textbackslash}begin\{equation*\} {\textbackslash}tag\{M\} where {\textbackslash}rho is a non-constant function. {\textbackslash}end\{equation*\} Of course, this definition generalizes at once to more general least squares type problems, where several parameters have to be determined. This class of estimators contains in particular (i) the sample mean \$({\textbackslash}rho(t) = t{\textasciicircum}2)\$, (ii) the sample median \$({\textbackslash}rho(t) = {\textbar}t{\textbar})\$, and more generally, (iii) all maximum likelihood estimators \$({\textbackslash}rho(t) = -{\textbackslash}log f(t)\$, where \$f\$ is the assumed density of the untranslated distribution). These (\$M\$)-estimators, as I shall call them for short, have rather pleasant asymptotic properties; sufficient conditions for asymptotic normality and an explicit expression for their asymptotic variance will be given. How should one judge the robustness of an estimator \$T\_n(x) = T\_n(x\_1, {\textbackslash}cdots, x\_n)\$? Since ill effects from contamination are mainly felt for large sample sizes, it seems that one should primarily optimize large sample robustness properties. Therefore, a convenient measure of robustness for asymptotically normal estimators seems to be the supremum of the asymptotic variance \$(n {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty)\$ when \$F\$ ranges over some suitable set of underlying distributions, in particular over the set of all \$F = (1 - {\textbackslash}epsilon){\textbackslash}Phi + {\textbackslash}epsilon H\$ for fixed \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ and symmetric \$H\$. On second thought, it turns out that the asymptotic variance is not only easier to handle, but that even for moderate values of \$n\$ it is a better measure of performance than the actual variance, because (i) the actual variance of an estimator depends very much on the behavior of the tails of \$H\$, and the supremum of the actual variance is infinite for any estimator whose value is always contained in the convex hull of the observations. (ii) If an estimator is asymptotically normal, then the important central part of its distribution and confidence intervals for moderate confidence levels can better be approximated in terms of the asymptotic variance than in terms of the actual variance. If we adopt this measure of robustness, and if we restrict attention to (\$M\$)-estimators, then it will be shown that the most robust estimator is uniquely determined and corresponds to the following \${\textbackslash}rho:{\textbackslash}rho(t) = {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}t{\textasciicircum}2\$ for \${\textbar}t{\textbar} {$<$} k, {\textbackslash}rho(t) = k{\textbar}t{\textbar} - {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}k{\textasciicircum}2\$ for \${\textbar}t{\textbar} {\textbackslash}geqq k\$, with \$k\$ depending on \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$. This estimator is most robust even among all translation invariant estimators. Sample mean \$(k = {\textbackslash}infty)\$ and sample median \$(k = 0)\$ are limiting cases corresponding to \${\textbackslash}epsilon = 0\$ and \${\textbackslash}epsilon = 1\$, respectively, and the estimator is closely related and asymptotically equivalent to Winsorizing. I recall the definition of Winsorizing: assume that the observations have been ordered, \$x\_1 {\textbackslash}leqq x\_2 {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}cdots {\textbackslash}leqq x\_n\$, then the statistic \$T = n{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}(gx\_\{g + 1\} + x\_\{g + 1\} + x\_\{g + 2\} + {\textbackslash}cdots + x\_\{n - h\} + hx\_\{n - h\})\$ is called the Winsorized mean, obtained by Winsorizing the \$g\$ leftmost and the \$h\$ rightmost observations. The above most robust (\$M\$)-estimators can be described by the same formula, except that in the first and in the last summand, the factors \$x\_\{g + 1\}\$ and \$x\_\{n - h\}\$ have to be replaced by some numbers \$u, v\$ satisfying \$x\_g {\textbackslash}leqq u {\textbackslash}leqq x\_\{g + 1\}\$ and \$x\_\{n - h\} {\textbackslash}leqq v {\textbackslash}leqq x\_\{n - h + 1\}\$, respectively; \$g, h, u\$ and \$v\$ depend on the sample. In fact, this (\$M\$)-estimator is the maximum likelihood estimator corresponding to a unique least favorable distribution \$F\_0\$ with density \$f\_0(t) = (1 - {\textbackslash}epsilon)(2{\textbackslash}pi){\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}\}e{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}rho(t)\}\$. This \$f\_0\$ behaves like a normal density for small \$t\$, like an exponential density for large \$t\$. At least for me, this was rather surprising--I would have expected an \$f\_0\$ with much heavier tails. This result is a particular case of a more general one that can be stated roughly as follows: Assume that \$F\$ belongs to some convex set \$C\$ of distribution functions. Then the most robust (\$M\$)-estimator for the set \$C\$ coincides with the maximum likelihood estimator for the unique \$F\_0 {\textbackslash}varepsilon C\$ which has the smallest Fisher information number \$I(F) = {\textbackslash}int (f'/f){\textasciicircum}2f dt\$ among all \$F {\textbackslash}varepsilon C\$. Miscellaneous related problems will also be treated: the case of non-symmetric contaminating distributions; the most robust estimator for the model of indeterminacy \${\textbackslash}sup\_t{\textbar}F(t) - {\textbackslash}Phi(t){\textbar} {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}epsilon\$; robust estimation of a scale parameter; how to estimate location, if scale and \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ are unknown; numerical computation of the estimators; more general estimators, e.g., minimizing \${\textbackslash}sum\_\{i {$<$} j\} {\textbackslash}rho(x\_i - T, x\_j - T)\$, where \${\textbackslash}rho\$ is a function of two arguments. Questions of small sample size theory will not be touched in this paper.},

  abstract = {New applications for single particle and photon detection in many fields require both large area imaging performance and precise time information on each detected particle. Moreover, a very high data acquisition rate is desirable for most applications and eventually the detection and imaging of more than one particle arriving within a microsecond is required. Commercial CCD systems lack the timing information whereas other electronic microchannel plate (MCP) read-out schemes usually suffer from a low acquisition rate and complicated and sometimes costly read-out electronics. We have designed and tested a complete imaging system consisting of an MCP position readout with helical wire delaylines, single-unit amplifier box and PC-controlled time-to-digital converter (TDC) readout. The system is very flexible and can detect and analyse position and timing information at single particle rates beyond 1 MHz. Alternatively, multihit events can be collected and analysed at about 20 kHz rate. We discuss the advantages and applications of this technique and then focus on the detector's ability to detect and analyse multiple hits. r 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here, taking angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) as an example, we demonstrate a denoising method that utilizes deep learning as an intelligent way to overcome the constraint. With readily available ARPES data and random generation of training datasets, we successfully trained the denoising neural network without overfitting. The denoising neural network can remove the noise in the data while preserving its intrinsic information. We show that the denoising neural network allows us to perform a similar level of second-derivative and line shape analysis on data taken with two orders of magnitude less acquisition time. The importance of our method lies in its applicability to any multidimensional spectral data that are susceptible to statistical noise.},

The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.

It creates the possibility of correlation experiments, such as the ground-breaking Hanbury Brown--Twiss experiment, leading to new physical insights. For low-energy electrons, one possibility is to use a Microchannel plate with subsequent delay lines for the readout of the incident particle hits, a setup called a Delay Line Detector. The spatial and temporal coordinates of more than one particle can be fully reconstructed outside a region called the dead radius. For interesting events, where two electrons are close in space and time, the determination of the individual positions of the electrons requires elaborate peak finding algorithms. While classical methods work well with single particle hits, they fail to identify and reconstruct events caused by multiple nearby particles. To address this challenge, we present a new spatiotemporal machine learning model to identify and reconstruct the position and time of such multi-hit particle signals. This model achieves a much better resolution for nearby particle hits compared to the classical approach, removing some of the artifacts and reducing the dead radius a factor of eight. We show that machine learning models can be effective in improving the spatiotemporal performance of delay line detectors.},

Recently it has been shown that such methods can also be trained without clean targets. Instead, independent pairs of noisy images can be used, in an approach known as Noise2Noise (N2N). Here, we introduce Noise2Void (N2V), a training scheme that takes this idea one step further. It does not require noisy image pairs, nor clean target images. Consequently, N2V allows us to train directly on the body of data to be denoised and can therefore be applied when other methods cannot. Especially interesting is the application to biomedical image data, where the acquisition of training targets, clean or noisy, is frequently not possible. We compare the performance of N2V to approaches that have either clean target images and/or noisy image pairs available. Intuitively, N2V cannot be expected to outperform methods that have more information available during training. Still, we observe that the denoising performance of Noise2Void drops in moderation and compares favorably to training-free denoising methods.},

  abstract = {Time-resolved photoemission with ultrafast pump and probe pulses is an emerging technique with wide application potential. Real-time recording of nonequilibrium electronic processes, transient states in chemical reactions, or the interplay of electronic and structural dynamics offers fascinating opportunities for future research. Combining valence-band and core-level spectroscopy with photoelectron diffraction for electronic, chemical, and structural analyses requires few 10 fs soft X-ray pulses with some 10 meV spectral resolution, which are currently available at high repetition rate free-electron lasers. We have constructed and optimized a versatile setup commissioned at FLASH/PG2 that combines free-electron laser capabilities together with a multidimensional recording scheme for photoemission studies. We use a full-field imaging momentum microscope with time-of-flight energy recording as the detector for mapping of 3D band structures in (kx, ky, E) parameter space with unprecedented efficiency. Our instrument can image full surface Brillouin zones with up to 7 {\AA}-1 diameter in a binding-energy range of several eV, resolving about 2.5 {\texttimes} 105 data voxels simultaneously. Using the ultrafast excited state dynamics in the van der Waals semiconductor WSe2 measured at photon energies of 36.5 eV and 109.5 eV, we demonstrate an experimental energy resolution of 130 meV, a momentum resolution of 0.06 {\AA}-1, and a system response function of 150 fs.},

Existing methods for collaborative filtering of stationary correlated noise have all used simple approximations of the transform noise power spectrum adopted from methods which do not employ block grouping. We note the inaccuracies of these approximations and introduce a method for the exact computation and effective approximations of the noise power spectrum. Unlike earlier methods, the calculated noise variances are exact even when noise in one block is correlated with noise in any of the other blocks. We discuss the adoption of the exact noise power spectrum within shrinkage, in similarity testing (block matching), and in aggregation. Extensive experiments support the proposed method over earlier crude approximations used by image denoising filters such as BM3D, demonstrating dramatic improvement in many challenging conditions.},

We also provided a MATLAB implementation of our method, where the exact unbiased inverse transformation appears in nonanalytical form. Here, we propose a closed-form approximation of the exact unbiased inverse in order to facilitate the use of this inverse. The proposed approximation produces results equivalent to those obtained with the accurate (nonanalytical) exact unbiased inverse, and thus, notably better than one would get with the asymptotically unbiased inverse transformation that is commonly used in applications.},

  abstract = {Free electrons are essential in such diverse applications as electron microscopes, accelerators and photoemission spectroscopy. However, the space charge effects of many electrons are often a problem and, when confined to extremely small space--time dimensions, even two electrons can interact strongly. Here we demonstrate that the resulting Coulomb repulsion can be highly advantageous, as it leads to strong electron--electron correlations. We show that femtosecond laser-emitted electrons from nanometric needle tips are highly anticorrelated in terms of energy because of dynamic Coulomb repulsion, with a visibility of 56\%. We extract a mean energy splitting of 3.3\,eV and a correlation decay time of 82\,fs. The energy-filtered electrons display a sub-Poissonian number distribution with a second-order correlation function as small as g(2)\,=\,0.34, implying that shot-noise-reduced pulsed electron beams can be realized by simple energy filtering. We also reach the strong-field regime of laser-driven electron emission and gain insights into how the electron correlations of the different electron classes (direct or rescattered) are influenced by the strong laser fields.},

  abstract = {A method for microspectroscopy and energy-selective imaging using a special photoemission electron microscope (PEEM) is presented. A modified commercial PEEM was combined with a delay line device as x, y, t detector serving as the basic arrangement for spectromicroscopy. One can measure the time of flight of the electrons passing a drift section in order to analyze the energy distribution of photoelectrons in PEEM. The time of flight is referenced to the time structure of the synchrotron radiation from an electron storage ring. At electron kinetic energies of less than 20 eV within the drift region a spatial resolution of about 100 nm has been obtained. Fast counting electronics (instead of a camera) delivers an image for real-time monitoring on an oscilloscope screen or for image acquisition by a computer. A time resolution of about 500 ps has been obtained with the potential of further improvement. The spatial resolution of the delay line detector is about 50 {$\mu$}m in the image plane corresponding to 1000 pixels in the image diagonal. Direct photoemission from the W-4f core level of a W(110) single-crystal sample was observed at several photon energies. The W-4f fine-structure splitting of 2.3 eV could be well resolved at a pass energy around 40 eV through the drift region.},

  abstract = {The present work enlightens the developments in time- and energy resolved photoemission electron microscopy over the past few years. We describe basic principles of the technique and demonstrate different applications. An energy- and time-filtering photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) for realtime spectroscopic imaging can be realized either by a retarding field or hemispherical energy analyzer or by using time-of-flight optics with a delay line detector. The latter method has the advantage of no data loss at all as all randomly incoming particles are measured not only by position but also by time. This is of particular interest for pump--probe experiments in the femtosecond and attosecond time scale where space charge processes drastically limit the maximum number of photoemitted electrons per laser pulse. This work focuses particularly on time-of-flight analysis using a novel delay line detector. Time and energy resolved PEEM instruments with delay line detectors enable 4D imaging (x, y,  t, EKin) on a true counting basis. This allows a broad range of applications from real-time observation of dynamic phenomena at surfaces to fs time-of-flight spectro-microscopy and even aberration correction.},

PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it was designed from first principles to support an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs. In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several commonly used benchmarks.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

We present also an introduction to the analysis of the diffraction effects using the FEL amplifier model. When exposing linear theory we use analytical techniques and the investigation of nonlinear modes in the operation of FEL devices is performed using the results of numerical simulations. The results of the linear theory serve as a primary standard to check the accuracy of numerical simulations. We perform a thorough analysis of the saturation effects in the FEL devices and of the methods to increase the FEL efficiency. A theoretical study is performed with a wide use of similarity techniques, so the obtained results are simultaneously of high degree of generality and completely specified. Numerous universal graphs illustrating various modes of the FEL operation together with the reduced design formulae can help the reader to find FEL characteristics using simple dimensional analysis only. It may be useful also for FEL designers, especially at the design stage of an experiment.},

The following statistical properties of the SASE FEL radiation have been studied in detail: time and spectral field correlations, distribution of the fluctuations of the instantaneous radiation power, distribution of the energy in the electron bunch, distribution of the radiation energy after the monochromator installed at the FEL amplifier exit and radiation spectrum. The linear high gain limit is studied analytically.

  abstract = {Photoelectron spectroscopy, especially at pulsed sources, is ultimately limited by the Coulomb interaction in the electron cloud, changing energy and angular distribution of the photoelectrons. A detailed understanding of this phenomenon is crucial for future pump--probe photoemission studies at (x-ray) free electron lasers and high-harmonic photon sources. Measurements have been performed for Ir(111) at h{$\nu$} = 1000 eV with photon flux densities between {$\sim$}102 and 104 photons per pulse and {$\mu$}m2 (beamline P04/PETRA III, DESY Hamburg), revealing space-charge induced energy shifts of up to 10 eV. In order to correct the essential part of the energy shift and restore the electron distributions close to the Fermi energy, we developed a semi-analytical theory for the space-charge effect in cathode-lens instruments (momentum microscopes, photoemission electron microscopes). The theory predicts a Lorentzian profile of energy isosurfaces and allows us to quantify the charge cloud from measured energy profiles. The correction is essential for the determination of the Fermi surface, as we demonstrate by means of `k-space movies' for the prototypical high-Z material tungsten. In an energy interval of about 1 eV below the Fermi edge, the bandstructure can be restored up to substantial shifts of {$\sim$}7 eV. Scattered photoelectrons strongly enhance the inelastic background in the region several eV below EF, proving that the majority of scattering events involves a slow electron. The correction yields a gain of two orders of magnitude in usable intensity compared with the uncorrected case (assuming a tolerable shift of 250 meV). The results are particularly important for future experiments at SASE-type free electron lasers, since the correction also works for strongly fluctuating (but known) pulse intensities.},

In the category real space \& spin the novel concept of imaging spin filters is discussed. In the time \& spin chapter we address time-of-flight spin detectors and ultrafast spin processes that are accessible by pump-and-probe techniques. A main part of the paper is devoted to the resolution of momentum-space \& time. This is implemented in form of the time-of-flight momentum microscope, a very recent development of which the first instrument has been in operation since 2014. In an extended outlook chapter, the potential of new developments and of a novel, highly parallelized delay-line type electron detector will be discussed. The combination of all three degrees of freedom k-space, time \& spin is emerging through the combination of the ToF momentum microscope with imaging spin filter.},

  abstract = {Machine learning is one of the fastest growing areas of computer science, with far-reaching applications. The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides a theoretical account of the fundamentals underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation of the basics, the book covers a wide array of central topics unaddressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability; important algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds. Designed for advanced undergraduates or beginning graduates, the text makes the fundamentals and algorithms of machine learning accessible to students and non-expert readers in statistics, computer science, mathematics and engineering.},

Here, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to go beyond the often-used ensemble-averaged view of non-equilibrium dynamics in terms of quasiparticle temperature evolutions. We show for ferromagnetic Ni that the non-equilibrium electron and spin dynamics display pronounced variations with electron momentum, whereas the magnetic exchange interaction remains isotropic. This highlights the influence of lattice-mediated scattering processes and opens a pathway toward unraveling the still elusive microscopic mechanism of spin-lattice angular momentum transfer.           ,              Non-equilibrium phonon-electron scattering leads to momentum-dependent transient electron and spin populations in Ni.},

In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned.     Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.},

To fully exploit the features of this new generation of light sources, a user facility with efficient radiation transport to the experimental area and novel online photon diagnostics capable of characterizing the unique parameters of the FLASH radiation has been built. It serves a broad user community active in many scientific fields ranging from atomic and molecular physics to plasma and solid state physics as well as chemistry and biology. A special focus is placed on the exploitation of the ultra-short FLASH pulses using pump--probe techniques. Thus, the facility is equipped with optical and THz sources synchronized to FLASH.

Generally, their excellent performance is imputed to their ability to learn realistic image priors from a large number of example images. In this paper, we show that, on the contrary, the structure of a generator network is sufficient to capture a great deal of low-level image statistics prior to any learning. In order to do so, we show that a randomly-initialized neural network can be used as a handcrafted prior with excellent results in standard inverse problems such as denoising, super-resolution, and inpainting. Furthermore, the same prior can be used to invert deep neural representations to diagnose them, and to restore images based on flash-no flash input pairs. Apart from its diverse applications, our approach highlights the inductive bias captured by standard generator network architectures. It also bridges the gap between two very popular families of image restoration methods: learning-based methods using deep convolutional networks and learning-free methods based on handcrafted image priors such as self-similarity (Code and supplementary material are available at https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/deep\_image\_prior).},

  abstract = {Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) denoising algorithm has been employed in many application fields because of its superior image processing quality. Due to the huge computational workload, real-time implementation of this algorithm is very challenging. Recently, studies on accelerating the BM3D algorithm on GPU have presented impressive speed up over CPU-based implementations. However, GPU devices are generally inefficient in energy dissipation and, thus, are not suitable for embedded application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a dedicated hardware accelerator design to efficiently boost the BM3D algorithm with reduced power consumption on FPGA device. The proposed design is based on a deeply pipelined OpenCL kernel architecture that can efficiently speed up the compute-intensive procedures of the denoising algorithm by exploiting the intrinsic parallelism and maximizing data reuse. The final design was implemented on Intel's Arria-10 GX1150 FPGA, and achieved an average 1.2{\texttimes} performance boost and an outstanding 8.3{\texttimes} reduction in energy dissipation when compared to a state-of-the-art GPU-based software design.},

  abstract = {Batch Normalization (BN) is a milestone technique in the development of deep learning, enabling various networks to train. However, normalizing along the batch dimension introduces problems --- BN's error increases rapidly when the batch size becomes smaller, caused by inaccurate batch statistics estimation. This limits BN's usage for training larger models and transferring features to computer vision tasks including detection, segmentation, and video, which require small batches constrained by memory consumption. In this paper, we present Group Normalization (GN) as a simple alternative to BN. GN divides the channels into groups and computes within each group the mean and variance for normalization. GN's computation is independent of batch sizes, and its accuracy is stable in a wide range of batch sizes. On ResNet-50 trained in ImageNet, GN has 10.6\% lower error than its BN counterpart when using a batch size of 2; when using typical batch sizes, GN is comparably good with BN and outperforms other normalization variants. Moreover, GN can be naturally transferred from pre-training to fine-tuning. GN can outperform its BN-based counterparts for object detection and segmentation in COCO, and for video classification in Kinetics, showing that GN can effectively replace the powerful BN in a variety of tasks. GN can be easily implemented by a few lines of code in modern libraries.},

  abstract = {The discriminative model learning for image denoising has been recently attracting considerable attentions due to its favorable denoising performance. In this paper, we take one step forward by investigating the construction of feed-forward denoising convolutional neural networks (DnCNNs) to embrace the progress in very deep architecture, learning algorithm, and regularization method into image denoising. Specifically, residual learning and batch normalization are utilized to speed up the training process as well as boost the denoising performance. Different from the existing discriminative denoising models which usually train a specific model for additive white Gaussian noise at a certain noise level, our DnCNN model is able to handle Gaussian denoising with unknown noise level (i.e., blind Gaussian denoising). With the residual learning strategy, DnCNN implicitly removes the latent clean image in the hidden layers. This property motivates us to train a single DnCNN model to tackle with several general image denoising tasks, such as Gaussian denoising, single image super-resolution, and JPEG image deblocking. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our DnCNN model can not only exhibit high effectiveness in several general image denoising tasks, but also be efficiently implemented by benefiting from GPU computing.},
