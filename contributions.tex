A preliminary analysis during the early works of this thesis titled
\textit{Efficient Data Acquisition in Multi-Dimensional Photoemission Spectroscopy using Denoising}, was presented, in the form a of poster, at the 87. Annual Meeting of DPG and DPG-Fr√ºhjahrstagung (DPG Spring Meeting) of the Condensed Matter Section (SKM) in Berlin, as well as NanoMat Science Day 2024 at DESY in Hamburg. 

Results from the deep learning denoising were presented at the \num{7}th Round Table on Deep Learning $@$DESY, in the form of a flash talk titled \textit{Deep-Learning based Image Denoising of MPES data}.
