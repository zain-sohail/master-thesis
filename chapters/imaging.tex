\section{Binning as means of Imaging}
digital imaging from lecture
sampling etc
Binning is a way to find underlying distribution.

Check the dld detector electron copies causing problem

\section{Poisson process checking}

There's a lot of parameters that need to be tested to determine what sort of counting statistics the dataset has.

Controls for the test:
lets see
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total time being looked at (like 1000 s or 20 hours)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item distribution might change due to overtime FEL intensity changes
    \end{itemize}
    \item Time bins being used (like 2 s vs 20 s and so on).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Seems like distribution changes based on that too
    \end{itemize}
    \item Looking at individual pixels on X and Y
    \item Looking at Energy axis as it behaves weirder
    \item Looking at a larger region in X and Y 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item should follow same statisitics as single pixels
    \end{itemize}
    \item Check after removing correlated electrons within each pulse
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It is possible that electrons are correlated between different pulses because the time delay is long enough. But seems highly unlikely!
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
