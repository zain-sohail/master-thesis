Rather than calling it denoising, better word in image reconstruction because
Image Reconstruction:

Purpose: To reconstruct an image from incomplete, noisy, or indirect measurements. This is often used in medical imaging (e.g., MRI, CT scans), computational photography, and computer vision applications. 

Reconstruction involves generating a complete image from partial or indirect data, which can include denoising and deblurring as sub-tasks.
