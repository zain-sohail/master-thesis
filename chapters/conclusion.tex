We use SASE currently but with seeded FEL, might be more robust poisson statistics. Maybe even sub-poissonian. 

There are a myriad of learning algorithms based on \gls{ERM}, that aim to minimize the expected loss $\mathcal{L}$ over a training set $\mathcal{S}$.  We have linear regression that aims to minimize the \gls{MSE} loss, logistic regression for binary classification\footnote{with softmax regression as a generalization for multi-class classification. The term "regression" is conventionally used, but this is actually a classification task.} that minimizes the cross-entropy loss, and support vector machines, that can be framed as a hinge loss minimization problem, aim to maximize the margin between different classes.
