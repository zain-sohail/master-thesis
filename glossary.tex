\newglossaryentry{sase}{
    name={Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission},
    description={is a process where the electron beam in the accelerator, when passing through an undulator, starts emitting radiation due to acceleration. The interaction between the emitted radiation and the charge distribution leads to microbunching. These microbunches emit radiation coherently, leading to the intense, coherent radition, characteristic of an \gls{FEL}. For more information see \cite{ackermann_operation_2007-1}}

\newglossaryentry{microbunch}{
    name={Microbunch},
    description={Microbunches are produced by the interaction between the oscillating electrons in the undulator and the radiation that they produce (due to the oscillatory acceleration) leads to periodic longitudinal density modulation known as Microbunching. The in-phase emitted radition adds coherently, increasing intensity and enhancing microbunching. Adapted from \cite{ackermann_operation_2007-1}},

\newglossaryentry{fel}{
    name={Free-Electron Laser},
    description={
    is an x-ray radiation source; fundamentally comprising of a linear particle accelerator and an \gls{undulator} (or a series of undulators). The accelerator produces a bunched electron beam similar to that of a synchrotron, which can be compressed to reach ultrashort pulse duration (femtosecond) with peak brightness many orders of magnitude above synchrotrons. Since the electrons move in a vacuum, it is termed Free-Electron in comparison to traditional lasers which are bound by the materials energy levels. Whereas, it is called a Laser due to there being light amplification and the shared properties with traditional optical lasers such as high pulse energy and being coherent.
